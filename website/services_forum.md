## Comment policy

### **Stay On-topic**

Be sure your comment matches the general theme of the page you are viewing.

### **Keep it civil**

Insults, personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, tribal, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing will be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it.

### **Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in**

Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you’re new there. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

### **Keep it tidy**

Help make moderators’ lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place. That means:

* don’t post off-topic comments or discussions
* don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
* check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted
* TRY NOT TO USE all caps.

### **If you see something, say something**

Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing community guidelines and, so are you. If you see an issue, [contact the moderators](mailto:registration@ipbes.net?subject=Forum%20moderation%20needed) if possible to flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated the Basic Rules, report it to the moderators.

### **No self-promotion**

A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed.

### **Don’t plagiarize**

Plagiarism is bad. Don't do it.

### **English only**

We currently only support English discussions. Non-English comments and discussions will be removed.

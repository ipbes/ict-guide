# IPBES ICT documentation

## Introduction

This repository holds the public user documentation for IPBES data management and IT services and tools. It is hosted on [ict.ipbes.net](https://ict.ipbes.net)

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is an independent intergovernmental body, established by member States in 2012. It provides policymakers with objective scientific assessments about the state of knowledge regarding the planetâ€™s biodiversity, ecosystems and the benefits they provide to people, as well as the tools and methods to protect and sustainably use these vital natural assets.

Our mission is to strengthen knowledge foundations for better policy through science, for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development. To some extent IPBES does for biodiversity what the IPCC does for climate change.

### Markdown

Our documentation site is built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/). GitBook uses Markdown as its file format.

* All files should end in `.md`. They should be all-lower-case and match the title of the page, or in some cases an abridged version of it.
* All pages should start with a title, denoted with # (first level header).
* Subsections within a page are encouraged, and should use ## for a 2nd level and ### for a 3rd level. Do not have more than 3 levels of header.
* Inline code statements, file names, and keys that would appear in a file should use backticks like this `` ` ``.
* Always use inline links.
* Do not hard-wrap prose text. Set your text editor to soft wrapping.
* Internal links should be absolute (starting with `/`) and link to a file ending in `.md`, not `.html`. That makes them easier to find when needed to update.

### Language usage

* All documentation should be written in English.

## Introduction

Cloud-based meeting recording, support for larger meetings of up to 250 participants; **teams** meetings, which provides the ability to host meetings across multiple organisations. Meetings in Teams include audio, video, and sharing.

## Schedule a meeting

Meetings can either be set up through the Microsoft Teams App or Outlook. There are several ways to schedule a meeting:

1. Select **Schedule a meeting** ![Schedule a meeting button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/fd1b3652-61b7-4822-b631-cf71577a241a.png)in a chat \(this is below the compose box\) to book a meeting with the people in the chat.
2. Go to **Calendar** ![Meetings button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/f788fe72-7168-45df-98c8-58ceac0a9aac.png)on the left side of the app and either select **New meeting** at the top right of the app, or select a range of time in your calendar and it will pop open a scheduling form.

Similar to Outlook, in the scheduling form is where you'll give a title to your meeting, invite people, and add meetings details.

On the right side of the scheduling form you will have the option to add a channel, individual people, or leave both blank to book yourself an appointment.

## Join a MS Teams meeting

You can join Teams meetings anytime, anywhere, from any device.

### Join by link

All you need to join a Teams meeting is a link.

When you open the link or select **Join Microsoft Teams Meeting** in your meeting invite, you’ll be directed to a page where you can choose to either join on the web or download the desktop app and then join. If you already have the Teams app, the meeting will open there automatically.

If you don’t have a Teams account and the organizer has allowed it, you may have the option to enter your name to join the meeting as a guest. If you do have a Teams account, select **Sign in** to join with access to the meeting chat and more. Then, depending on the organizer’s settings, you may join the meeting right away or go to the lobby where people in the meeting can admit you.

### Join by phone

Even if you don’t have internet access or the Teams app, you can join some meetings by phone. If it has a phone number and conference ID in the meeting invite, just dial to join.

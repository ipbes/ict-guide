# Microsoft Teams

## Introduction

A **team** is a group of people gathered to get something big done in your organisation. Sometimes it’s your whole organisation.

Teams are made up of **channels**, which are the conversations you have with your teammates. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project.

# Microsoft SharePoint

## **Introduction**

SharePoint Online is a web-based platform designed to enhance collaboration through cloud storage, content management and data sharing. It allows users to access internal sites, documents, and other information from anywhere on the web.

It is different from OneDrive – your personal space. SharePoint Online sites are created to store files and folders that you want to share with colleagues within the Organization.

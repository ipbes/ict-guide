# Microsoft OneDrive

## Introduction

OneDrive for Business is your private space and a great place to save your work. OneDrive is for documents you don’t plan to share with many colleagues, like draft documents or personal documents that others don’t need to see. It’s also a good choice for ad-hoc collaboration with a limited scope of colleagues or for documents with a brief lifecycle.

It might be tempting to save all your documents to OneDrive since it’s easy and convenient. However, you need to think about the content that you have there and consider the implications. If a document is a collaborative effort related to a project or needs to be preserved as part of the Organization’s records, Unite Docs would be a better choice.
